# Hi there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a software developer with a focus on **C**, **C++**, and **Python**. I enjoy building robust backend systems, exploring **network programming**, and enhancing my skills with **parallel computing** and **assembly language** on **Raspberry Pi**.

### 🛠️ Technologies & Tools:
- **Languages**: C, C++, Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, React, Flask, SQL (MySQL)
- **Frameworks & Libraries**: Flask, React, React Router, Pthreads, Docker
- **Tools**: Git, tmux, Docker, VSCode
- **Databases**: MySQL
- **OS**: Linux, Raspberry Pi OS

### 👨‍💻 Current Projects:
- **AudioSync**: A music streaming app built with Flask and React. I'm working on:
  - User authentication (JWT)
  - Search functionality for artists and songs
  - Integration with external APIs (e.g., Spotify for album covers)
  - Frontend routing and dynamic components in React
- **Sparse Matrix Multiplication**: Optimizing parallel matrix multiplication using row-based workload splitting.
- **Network Programming**: Building basic servers in C, experimenting with socket programming.

### 🌱 Learning & Exploring:
- **Assembly programming** on Raspberry Pi.
- Improving my **TypeScript** and **JavaScript** skills through intermediate-to-advanced projects.
- Enhancing my knowledge of **database design** and **optimization** with MySQL.

### 🧠 Other Interests:
- **Systems Programming**: Understanding the internals of operating systems and how to optimize code for performance.
- **Open Source Contributions**: I'm looking to contribute to projects related to network programming and parallel computing.
